project_v1 contains far too much redundancy and useless functions, this is a code cleanup before attempting a proper refactoring

What needs to be present:
1. be able to reproduce work from paper I
    - snapshots
    - downstream values and shock strength
    - time series
    - fit downstream values with bplaw
    - peak modeling
    - radiation from a shocked cell
    - contribution from all shocked cells
2. add new work
    - cell history
    - add electron distribution (injection + cooling with history)
    - cell contribution to radiation

plotting can be added later tbh
