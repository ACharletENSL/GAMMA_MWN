Post-processing
- proper rewrite emission, agnostic of colliding shells
    (no need to be too much of a proper software, this is a later point)
- rewrite calculations in C/C++ with Py wrapper? Include directly with GAMMA?
- proper Py package? Include astropy, compare with things like jetsimpy, etc.

- evolution of microphysics
    p already implemented, what about eps_e, eps_e, zeta?
    Asano paper (check his presentation of HEPRO VIII if still exists)
- add IC cooling? 
    start with simplifying assumption inside one 1D track
    Pellouin & Daigne 24 (formulation + simple que le Kumar et al. 09)
- polarisation? 
    with hydro only we can use assumptions on B field and apply the method for a pulse
    Gill & Granot 2021, Gill Granot Kumar 2020
    -> certainly will not give very useful results in our 1D approach but the 2D can be very intersting from the rise of instabilities such as RTI
- better prim2cons?
    already started with Newman & Hamlin 14 but not tested well yet
    compare with Kastaun et al. 21 (they give a comparison in the article)
- MHD?
    HLLD Mignone+ 09, Mignone & DelZanna 20
