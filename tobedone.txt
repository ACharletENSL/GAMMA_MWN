Plans for code update. Main philosophy -> one config file to rule them all:
small txt file with physical and grid parameters

-> copy params file in the results folder systematically, data analysis & plotting will read from there

python script to:
    update job name and automate results folder name/key


plotting:
    better separation between data handling and plot creation
