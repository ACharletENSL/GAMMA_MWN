Done
- criterion of merging according dr/r -> added but rough
- need to take refinement into account -> for now, is not compatible
- adaptive time step for large scales ? -> there's none
- added timestep plot to identify problematic zones

To finish
- physically coherent initial setup
- finish implement+test cons2prim Newman & Hanlin
- complete setup gestion (copy phys file, sim name, etc.)
- rework zone id
- and more

Read papers
- can we accelerate timestep in relativistic hot fluid?
