Plans for code update. Main philosophy -> one config file to rule them all:
small txt file with physical and grid parameters

-> copy params file in the results folder systematically, data analysis & plotting will read from there

python script to:
    create physical setup (grid map with r, dr, rho, v, p) using physical model (self-similar, etc.)
    update job name and automate results folder name/key

Initial file (MWN1D.cpp) to read this map to initialize

plotting:
    better separation between data handling and plot creation
