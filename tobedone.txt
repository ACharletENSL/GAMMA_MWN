Done
- criterion of merging according dr/r -> added but rough
- need to take refinement into account -> for now, is not compatible
- adaptive time step for large scales ? -> there's none
- added timestep plot to identify problematic zones


To finish
- physically coherent initial setup
- finish implement+test cons2prim Newman & Hanlin
- complete setup gestion (copy phys file, sim name, etc.)
- rework zone id, including use of shock detection
- and more
- add normalization choice to setup
- rego into cell resolution:
-> determine some dr/r fraction acceptable + way to check it
- be able to change normalization of plots on the fly
-> continue electron distribution & radiation work -> postprocessing

ALE to smooth between lagrangian in cold relat speed flows and eulerian in hot slow flows??
-> criterion based on wave / sound speed ratio?
-> dump local dt?
-> should not work: you will be limited by sound speed in any case

Clean run_analysis of old functions
Update shock strength to Mach number of shock velocity in unshocked medium

Todolist:
1. Cell resolution, numerics, and plotting
- find a way to fuse cells in the shocked nebula but not too much
- once we're only limited by cells at shocks, asks about adaptive timestep
- recheck N&H cons2prim and RC EoS
- add theoretical estimates (expected Rcd growth rate with time)
- choice of x, y normalization on plot function

2. Shocks and self-similarity
- shock detection in post-processing 
-> will be useful in lots of cases: especially analyzing sims ran without it -> update zone id
- change shock strength to Mach number (of shock front in unshocked medium)
- PREPARE TALK ON SELF-SIMILARITY -> send references to Minu

3. Emitted radiation
- write post-processing of sim
-> first using the gamma_min and gamma_max from GAMMA
-> from shock detection in our method
First only one power-law, then add before and after gamma_min & gamma_max + cooling regimes

4. Jets in GAMMA
- make a setup file -> kinda done but hard to check in 2D
- discussion with Frederic Daigne
- papiers Ayache Daigne, Lamberts Daigne pour comparer les approches
- question du reverse shock dans l'afterglow (diversité des lightcurves difficile à expliquer avec FS seulement)
-> parler de notre taf avec Minu
- variabilité de l'injection -> variabilité du profil de densité qui peut influencer le passage du RS
- faut vraiment les lightcurves ptn
- Uhm, Zhang 2012 -> checker le Uhm Beloborodov 2007 pour la méthode

5. Internal shocks: collision of two (cold) shells 
-> ask Minu
-> relative Lorentz factor, densities ratio, shell width, collision radius...
equal width in the lab frame is a good starting assumption
-> redo current test case in planar and spherical

Done (clear and update between meetings):
- add dr/r plots to check
