Done
- criterion of merging according dr/r -> added but rough
- need to take refinement into account -> for now, is not compatible
- adaptive time step for large scales ? -> there's none
- added timestep plot to identify problematic zones


To finish
- physically coherent initial setup
- finish implement+test cons2prim Newman & Hanlin
- complete setup gestion (copy phys file, sim name, etc.)
- rework zone id, including use of shock detection
- and more
- add normalization choice to setup
- rego into cell resoltuion:
-> determine some dr/r fraction acceptable + way to check it
- be able to change normalization of plots on the fly
-> continue electron distribution & radiation work -> postprocessing

ALE to smooth between lagrangian in cold relat speed flows and eulerian in hot slow flows??
-> criterion based on wave / sound speed ratio?
-> dump local dt?
-> should not work: you will be limited by sound speed in any case

Clean run_analysis of old functions
Update shock strength to Mach number of shock velocity in unshocked medium

Todolist:
1. Cell resolution
- find a way to fuse cells in the shocked nebula but not too much
- add dr/r plots to check
- once we're only limited by cells at shocks, asks about adaptive timestep

2. Shocks and self-similarity
- shock detection in post-processing (will be useful in lots of cases: especially analyzing sims ran without it)
- change shock strength to Mach number (of shock front in unshocked medium)
- PREPARE TALK ON SELF-SIMILARITY

3. Emitted radiation
- write post-processing of sim
-> first using the gamma_min and gamma_max from GAMMA
-> from shock detection in our method
First only one power-law, then add before and after gamma_min & gamma_max + cooling regimes

4. Jets in GAMMA
- make a setup file
- discussion with Frederic Daigne

5. Internal shocks: collision of two (cold) shells 
-> ask Minu
-> relative Lorentz factor, densities ratio, shell width, collision radius...
equal width in the lab frame is a good starting assumption
-> redo current test case in planar and spherical
