Plans for code update. Main philosophy -> one config file to rule them all:
small txt file with physical and grid parameters

-> copy params file in the results folder systematically, data analysis & plotting will read from there

relaunch without checkCellForRegrid
grid in dr/r
add other method cons2prim
    check if method for regridding/refinment level ?
what causes crash at 150000 it
why dx noise doesn't follow density/so different from dx injection noise?

physically coherent initial setup
